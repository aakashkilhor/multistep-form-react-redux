# Multi-Step Form Web App

This is a web application built with React that implements a multi-step form with data persistence. The form consists of multiple steps, each gathering different sets of information. The entered data is persisted even if the page is reloaded, allowing users to continue filling out the form where they left off.

## Features

- Multi-step form with four steps: Basic Details, Contact Info, Address, and About Info.
- Data persistence: Entered data is stored locally and retrieved upon reloading the page.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Submit button on the last step to finalize the form submission.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: Predictable state container for managing application state.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the user interface.
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and functionality.
- Local Storage: Browser's built-in storage mechanism for persisting data.
